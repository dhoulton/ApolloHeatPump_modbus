# ApolloHeatPump_modbus

Config/Setup for controlling an Apollo Air-Source Heat Pump via Home Assistant.

**Note: If you go messing with the modbus registers in your Heat Pump, it it certainly possible for you to break something. If you do that, I cannot help you recover. Be careful, go slow, and make backups.**
